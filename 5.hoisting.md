hoisting: Fn, classes and variables are declared on the top of the scope but not initilized  during the compilation phase.

Note: 
    ‘var’ variables are hoisted with undefined, while ‘let’ and ‘const’ are hoisted but remain in the Temporal Dead Zone until initialized.

Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):

    The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a critical concept in JavaScript hoisting. It refers to the period between the entering of a scope (such as a function or block) and the actual initialization of a variable declared with let or const. During this time, any reference to the variable before its initialization will throw a ReferenceError.

TDZ = period b/w entering the scope + actual initialization of a variable.
